Description:

Foo Corp needs a system to control their employees attendance to their offices, they need full visibility of who went to work at what time and when they left. They need a webpage that will be opened in a tablet at the lobby of each branch, where the employee can go in and specify their private number and the system will record internally the time they checked in and the time they checked out.
